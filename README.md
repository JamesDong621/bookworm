Ensure the installation environment:
• Ensure the following tools are installed:

• Node.js and npm

• Python and related dependencies (such as pip, virtual environment)

• For front-end projects, check whether there is a package.json file.

• For back-end projects, ensure that the app.py file exists and that the Python library it depends on is installed.

Run the front-end project:
• Enter the front-end project directory in the terminal: cd public/frontend/home

• Execute npm install to install all dependencies.

• Execute npm start to start the front-end development environment.

Run the back-end project:
• Open another terminal and enter the back-end project directory: cd bookworm/backend

• Ensure that the dependencies required by app.py are installed. You can run: pip install -r requirements.txt (if there is a requirements.txt file).

• Execute python app.py to start the back-end service.
